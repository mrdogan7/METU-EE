**Project:** 

Hyphotesis testing by observation of various amplitude or frequency modulated signals.

**Procedure:**

In the first phase of the project, a randomly AM/FM modulated signal is generated by *signal_generation_group_10.m* MATLAB file. This generated signal is fed to *signal_identifier_group_10.m* MATLAB file to decide whether the input is AM or FM modulated with low or high modulating index.

In the second phase, this randomly generated signal is broadcasted from an external transmitter, USRP Device, and received by an RTL-SDR receiver dongle. Then, a similar procedure with the first phase is applied to detect the type and the carrier frequency of received signal.
